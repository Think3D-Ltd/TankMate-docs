# v2 Battery Replacement

{% hint style="info" %}
Prior to October 2021, TankMate v2 sensors were supplied with a single C size, 3.6V lithium battery. These can be hard to source, and there are a variety of similar batteries that do not work in a TankMate sensor. **We recommend installing the AA battery adapter** - [sold here](https://tankmate.co.nz/collections/accessories/products/replacement-battery-pack?variant=40113642504398).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: the following battery types **will not be suitable** to power a TankMate unit

* **Heavy duty** type cells&#x20;
* A single **1.5V C-size** cell&#x20;
* **ER26500** C-size lithium
{% endhint %}

**Tools required:** Phillips / Pozi screwdriver #2; Flat screwdriver #1

**Recommended AA Batteries:  Energizer Ultimate Lithium L91 (AA size, 1.5v)** / or Alkaline type

Models with a v2.60 PCB use a plug in connector for the battery, and do not have screw terminals

2. Turn the unit OFF, using the slide switch&#x20;
3. Remove the existing C-size lithium battery&#x20;
