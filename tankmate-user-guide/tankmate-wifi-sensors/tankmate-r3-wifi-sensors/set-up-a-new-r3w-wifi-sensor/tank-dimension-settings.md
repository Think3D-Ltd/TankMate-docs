# Tank Dimension Settings

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/Tank\_Dimensions\_APP.png)

To correctly configure the tank dimensions for a TankMate level sensor, the following settings need to be configured in the mobile app:

**Overflow Height (h2)** - this will set the maximum fill level (100% level) for the tank, in **metres**. If you have an inground tank and the overflow pipe is difficult to locate, you can measure the height from the tank floor to the underside of the tank roof. Subtract 100mm from this measurement to estimate the overflow height.

**Outlet Height (h1)** - this will set the minimum level (0% level) for the tank, in **millimetres**. With a moulded plastic tank, the outlet is usually around 100mm above the base of the tank. For tanks with submersible pumps, set this value slightly higher.

**Tank Diameter (d)** - this will set the volume of the tank, in **metres**. Note that in the mobile app there are three ways to define the tank volume: 1) volume (Litres), 2) diameter.&#x20;

**Sensor Height (h)** - this is the height from the bottom of the tank to the base of the sensor. The easiest way to measure this is with a tape measure - after the hole has been drilled, as shown below
