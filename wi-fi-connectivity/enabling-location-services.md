# Enabling Location Services

The TankMate app **uses location services** to be able to **find the name of your WiFi network**. Without  this enabled, you will not be able to configure a WiFi sensor.

### iOS

* Ensure [location service is turned on](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207092) for your phone, **AND** for the TankMate app

{% hint style="success" %}
In the TankMate app, from the Settings menu, select the "Add New Sensor" option.  The app will **prompt you to enable locations services**. After enabling this, if you are connecting an existing sensor you can exit the "Add New Sensor" process, and edit the network settings for the existing sensor.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Android

* Turn [location ON](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3467281?hl=en)
* Find TankMate in your list of apps ([Settings > Apps > TankMate](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9431959?hl=en)) and check which permissions are allowed. Enable "**Location**"
* Or, access the permissions from the [app icon as shown here](https://guidebooks.google.com/android/changesettingspermissions/changeyourapppermissions?utm\_campaign=HC\_9431959\_Aug21)
