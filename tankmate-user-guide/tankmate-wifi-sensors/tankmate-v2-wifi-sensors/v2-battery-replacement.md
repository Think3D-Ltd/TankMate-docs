# v2 Battery Replacement

{% hint style="info" %}
Prior to October 2021, TankMate v2 sensors were supplied with a single C size, 3.6V lithium battery. These can be hard to source, and there are a variety of similar batteries that do not work in a TankMate sensor. **We recommend removing the C-size battery completely, and installing a 3 x AA battery adapter.**
{% endhint %}

**Recommended AA Batteries:  Energizer Ultimate Lithium L91 (AA size, 1.5v)** / or **Alkaline** type

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please check how your existing battery is connected to the board! Later models use a white plug, while&#x20;

v2.01 and v2.30 PCBs with **screw terminals -** use this type:

* JayCar - [3 X AA Side by Side Flat Battery Holder](https://www.jaycar.co.nz/3-x-aa-side-by-side-flat-battery-holder/p/PH9274)



v2.60 PCBs require a **JST PH 2.0** **plug-in connector** **-** use this type:

* DigiKey - [1738-FIT0619-ND](https://www.digikey.co.nz/en/products/detail/dfrobot/FIT0619/10230092?s=N4IgTCBcDaIIwHYDMAOAtAMQJIBUAMAbHAJxoByAIiALoC%2BQA)
