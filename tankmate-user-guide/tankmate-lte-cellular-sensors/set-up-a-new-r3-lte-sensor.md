See the Quick Start Guide pdf
{% endfile %}

### 1) Add a new LTE sensor to the TankMate APP

* **Download the TankMate app** from your app store
* Create a **new account** with one of the "**Sign Up**" options
* In the app, select **R3** - on the "Add New Sensor" screen&#x20;
* Scan the **QR code** - located under the base of the sensor

### 2) Activate the sensor

* **Hold the RESET button** underneath the unit for **6+ seconds**
* After releasing, the sensor will **beep twice**
* The **status LED** will **blink **<mark style="color:green;">**GREEN**</mark> while it searches for a network. This can take up to a minute
* Once the sensor **connects to a cellular network**, it will **blink **<mark style="color:blue;">**light BLUE**</mark> (cyan), and then become a <mark style="color:blue;">**solid BLUE**</mark> (cyan) colour for a few seconds<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/wifi_connect.gif" alt="" data-size="line">
* Some **audible beeps** will also be heard at this point

{% hint style="danger" %}
If the **status LED blinks RED** after a minute, the sensor has **failed to connect** to a callular network
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Activating the sensor is **best done outdoors**. If necessary, move to an **area with better signal** to get an **initial connection**.

You may need to repeat this step, if the initial attempt fails
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
If you **swipe down to refresh** the **dashboard** (main) screen of the **app**, you can see the **last reading date / time** - to confirm that data has been sent from the sensor
{% endhint %}

### 3) Drill a hole in the tank

### 4) Set your tank dimensions

* [See here for how to set tank dimensions](../tankmate-wifi-sensors/tankmate-r3-wifi-sensors/set-up-a-new-r3-sensor/tank-dimension-settings.md)

### &#x20;5) Take an initial level reading on the tank

* With the rubber gasket and lens in place, **press the READ button** once on the underside of the sensor&#x20;
* **Check** that the sensor has a network **connection** (look for **BLUE LED**, as above)
* When the **sensor starts beeping** and **blinking ORANGE**, place the **sensor on the tank**. Hold it in place for now. There is a **10 second countdown / delay** before the reading is taken

{% hint style="success" %}
In the app, **swipe down to refresh** the **dashboard** (main) screen of the **app.** You should see the **last reading date / time** update - to confirm that data has been sent from the sensor. The **tank level and fill percentage should also update**.
