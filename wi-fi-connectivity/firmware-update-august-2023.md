# Firmware Update - August 2023

{% hint style="info" %}
From August 2023, all **TankMate v2 and R3 WiFi sensors** began migration to a **new server**. For **all connected devices** this was done **over-the-air**, from August to November. The sensor operation would not have been affected.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If your sensor appears to be **connecting** to a WiFi network, but **no new data** is appearing in the app, please **check your firmware version** (home screen of the app > expand to see device details). If your sensor was offline for several months, it may have missed the update. The sensor will need to be sent to one of our workshops for a **manual firmware update**. Contact us for details.

**Hardware Status:**

* Status LED = solid blue/cyan, stays on for up to a minute
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**All R3 and v2 WiFi units** need to be running the following firmware versions:

* R3W (radar sensor) - **v52 or above**
* v2 (pressure sensor) - **v21 or above**
{% endhint %}
